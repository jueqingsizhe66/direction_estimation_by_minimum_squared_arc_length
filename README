Latex and simulation scripts for the paper:

R. G. McKilliam, B. G. Quinn, and I. V. L. Clarkson. Direction estimation by minimum squared arc length. submitted to IEEE Trans. Signal Process., Mar. 2011.

Data from the simulations already exists in this repository (the same data as used in the paper).  If you are using bash then

sh buildfigsandpdf.sh

will build the pdf using this data.  The pdf is called papersm.pdf.  If you want to run all the simulations again use

sh runsimulationsandbuildpdf.sh

You need a working java jvm and also Scala 2.8 or higher installed.  Depending on your machine this might take a while.  Open up the bash script and work backwards to get at the code.  The code uses the pubsim library which is available at 

https://github.com/robbymckilliam/pubsim.  

An executable for this library is packaged inside this repository.
